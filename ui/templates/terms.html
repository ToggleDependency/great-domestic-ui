<h2 class="heading-medium">Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>
	This Privacy Statement explains how we use the information you submit to us, including any personal information, in relation to the Directory. We value your trust and your privacy is important to us, so we will keep your information secure and manage it in accordance with our legal responsibilities. By providing us with information, you agree to it being used and disclosed in the manner set out in this Statement.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">What information do we collect and what do we use it for?</h3>

<p>We collect information we need in order to consider your application for pre-registration on the Directory. Ultimately, we may use this same information to create an entry relating to your business on the Directory:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
	<li>Company name;</li>
	<li>Company address;</li>
	<li>Contact name;</li>
	<li>Email address;</li>
	<li>Telephone number;</li>
	<li>Website;</li>
	<li>Preferred contact channel;</li>
	<li>Companies house number;</li>
	<li>Sector</li>
	<li>Product or service offered;</li>
	<li>Description of product or service.</li>
</ul>

<p>[Whilst you are not required to provide all of this information to us, the more information you provide, the more successful your entry on the Directory is likely to be.]</p>

<p>You understand that, if your application for pre-registration is successful, the information above will be included on a publicly accessible platform.</p>

<p>We also ask you for some additional information. This information is not for inclusion on the Directory, but will be used by trained professionals within our organisation to research and analyse the behaviour and make-up of exporting businesses, in order to produce relevant reports. Any reports produced will only include aggregated data, from which it will not be possible to identify individuals or individual businesses. The additional information we request is as follows:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
	<li>Exporting experience;</li>
	<li>Frequency of exports;</li>
	<li>Turnover accountable to exports;</li>
	<li>Destinations to which you export;</li>
	<li>Range of export destinations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="heading-small">Who else do we provide your information to?</h3>

<p>In determining your application for pre-registration, your information may be reviewed by a number of members within our team, and by members of other UK Government departments.</p>

<p>[Creation of the Directory requires assistance from third party service providers, for example hosting services and developers, and we may need to disclose your information to these third parties.]</p>

<p>Upon launch, the Directory will be a publicly accessible platform. Therefore, if an entry relating to your business is included, your information will be freely accessible on that basis.</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Contacting you</h3>

<p>We may contact you from time to time to update you on your application for pre-registration, and with news about the progress of the Directory.</p>

<p>Subject to the prior provision of your consent to do so, we may also use your contact details to get in touch with you in relation to other campaigns we are running as the UK&#39;s exporting champion, or to highlight export opportunities which may suit your business. You may opt out of these additional communications at any time by using the unsubscribe link included in our emails, or by writing to us at the address set out below.</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Keeping your information secure</h3>

<p>We are committed to handling your personal information and data with integrity and care and invest appropriate resources to protect your personal information, from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. However, in relation to the Directory, no internet-based platform can be 100% secure and so there is always a risk for unauthorised or unintended access to your information by third parties that is beyond our control.</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Your rights to your personal information</h3>

<p>In respect of any personal information (or &quot;personal data&quot;) provided to us for pre-registration, and subsequently as included on the Directory, we are the data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ol class="list list-roman">
	<li>
		request a copy of your personal information from us, together with details about how we use that information, subject to a fee of Â£10 which is payable in advance; and
	</li>

	<li>
		if you think any of the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request it is corrected.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to take either of the above actions, please contact us at [CONTACT DETAILS]. We will endeavour to respond to your requests within all applicable timeframes.</p>

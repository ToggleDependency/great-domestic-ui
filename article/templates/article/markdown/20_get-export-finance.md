Trade and export finance can refer to specific financial products that reduce the risks that come with selling internationally, and may include:

* guarantees or [letters of credit]({% url_with_source 'decide-when-youll-get-paid' %}#Share-the-risk "letters of credit") to help you get paid
* working capital loans to fulfil orders
* insurance against not being paid
* finance to your overseas buyer to allow them to pay for your goods and services over a longer period

Many [chambers of commerce](http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/find-your-chamber/ "find your local chamber of commerce") offer services to help with letter of credit documentation.

Your bank should be able to help you with loans, guarantees and letters of credit.

For export insurance, see the government&rsquo;s [list of approved export insurance brokers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-export-finance-insurance-list-of-approved-brokers/export-insurance-approved-brokers "UK Export Finance approved insurance brokers").

If you&rsquo;re exporting to a high risk country and your bank or credit insurer can&rsquo;t help, you may qualify for government-backed finance or insurance from [UK Export Finance (UKEF)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance "Find out more about UKEF").

UKEF is the UK&rsquo;s export credit agency.  It aims to make sure no viable export fails due to a lack of finance or insurance. It helps support exports from the UK by:

* guaranteeing loans and financial products to UK exporters and their suppliers
* offering finance to overseas buyers of UK goods and services
* providing insurance for higher-risk countries outside of certain richer countries, such as in Europe and North America
* applying internationally agreed standards in due diligence to deter bribery and corruption in transactions officially supported by export credits
* applying policies relating to the environment, social and human rights, anti-bribery and corruption and sustainable lending, which are monitored by the Export Guarantees Advisory Council, who can advise the Secretary of State

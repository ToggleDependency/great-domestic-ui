Export finance can refer to specific financial products that reduce the risks that come with selling internationally. They are usually short-term products that include:

* loans to fulfil orders
* guarantees or [letters of credit](/getting-paid/decide-when-youll-get-paid#Share-the-risk "letters of credit") to help you get paid
* insurance against not being paid

Your bank should be able to help you with short-term loans, guarantees and letters of credit.

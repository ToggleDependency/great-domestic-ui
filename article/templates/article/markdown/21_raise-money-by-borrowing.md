Start with your own bank. They know you and your business so are better placed to advise on the best finance options for your situation. 

If your bank can&rsquo;t help, shop around for a bank that can. Some banks will be more experienced in export finance than others. 

Business loans come in different shapes and sizes. As with raising any finance, you&rsquo;ll need a well considered plan that shows the growth you expect to achieve and how you&rsquo;ll pay back the debt.

If your company is less than 24 months old you could be eligible for a [Start Up Loan](https://www.gov.uk/apply-start-up-loan "Apply for a Start Up Loan").

### Peer-to-peer lending

Businesses that want to lend are matched with businesses that want to borrow through an online platform. The loan is usually made up of small amounts from several lenders. These loans are often processed more quickly than a bank loan.

Interest rates are either fixed or lenders bid for a loan based on the interest rate they are prepared to lend at.

You have to submit accounts and go through credit checks to register for a loan on most platforms.

[The Peer-to-Peer Finance Association](http://p2pfa.info/p2pfa-members "Peer-to-Peer Finance Association") has a list of peer-to-peer lending sites.

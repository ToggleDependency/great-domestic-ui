# Title: Internationalise your website
[comment]: Personas: New to exporting, Occasional

Having a website is vital to promote and sell your products internationally. Having a website will help buyers to:

 - have confidence that you&rsquo;re an established business
 - see what you&rsquo;re selling in greater detail
 - show you&rsquo;re business to their colleagues


### Buy your company domain

When you set up your website you need to decide on the website name, also known as the domain name. Most people call this a URL. Your domain name should:

- include your company name
- be short and easy to remember
- describe your business (if the name is not available)
- be in lowercase

Having a short, accurate domain name will make it easier for buyers to find and remember your website, and improve your site engine optimisation (SEO). Good SEO improves your ranking in search engine results.

### Choose your domain extension

A domain extension is the .com, .co.uk, .org of a website URL. Domain extensions have different meanings so it&rsquo;s important to choose the right one for your business. As a UK business, your domain extension should be .co.uk.

If you want to have a website in a specific country other than the UK, you could: 

- choose a domain extension suitable for that country, such as website.cn for China
- use a subdomain, such as website.com/cn

Be aware that:

- website registration rules and costs vary between countries
- you might not be able to buy a local domain extension if your company is not based in that country

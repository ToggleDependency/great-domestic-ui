# Title: IP protection in multiple countries
[comment]: Personas: Occasional, Regular

You only need to make one application for a trade mark or patent within the EU. Outside of the EU, you&rsquo;ll generally have to make one application for every country in which you want protection.

You can also make international applications that cover multiple countries around the world, cutting down on administration and costs.

Depending on the country, you&rsquo;ll need to research how you can apply for IP or you can use an IP lawyer. Using an IP lawyer makes the process easier as they can: 

- apply on your behalf
- offer expert IP advice based on your business plan 
- have connections with lawyers in other countries

Read the Intellectual Property Office&rsquo;s guidance on:

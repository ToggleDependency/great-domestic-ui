When you sell directly to overseas customers you’re responsible for everything from finding new clients through to after-sales support. You have control over each stage of the sales process allowing you to: 

- set higher margins
- get to know the market
- build a personal relationship with your customers 
- see what your competitors are doing
- plan an effective market strategy

### More resource and risk

Doing everything yourself takes a lot of resource. You’ll need to visit customers overseas and either speak the language or hire an interpreter. The time and money you invest exposes you to risk if something unexpected happens. 

You may find that selling directly isn’t scalable for the size of your business and that using an agent or distributor are more cost effective routes to market.

Consider joining a trade mission to your target market or attending in-country exhibitions or events. When it comes to bigger field research projects, you may want to use a market research agency.

Doing field research in-house can keep costs down but may need a dedicated member of staff. There will be costs associated with visiting the country and you may need to pay for a translator. If you&rsquo;re unsure about research techniques and questionnaire design, contact the in-country [Chambers of Commerce](http://exportbritain.org.uk/international-directory/ "Chambers of Commerce") for advice.

Appointing a market research agency can be expensive but their results should be thorough and objective. Select one you trust and brief them well. Make sure their proposal includes:

- what they&rsquo;re researching and how
- a breakdown of costs and expenses
- timescales and the report format
- a confidentiality agreement

### Use the government&rsquo;s overseas network

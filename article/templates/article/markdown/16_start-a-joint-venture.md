A joint venture is when 2 or more companies come together for a project. They remain separate entities but share costs, profits and losses as set out in a joint venture agreement. 

Before starting a joint venture think carefully about:

- cultural differences
- the terms of your agreement
- how you might protect your investment 
- if your management styles and skills are a good fit	

Get legal advice to draw up an agreement that clearly defines roles and responsibilities. Make sure you have a level of control you are happy with and [protect your intellectual property]({% url 'what-intellectual-property-is' %} "what intellectual property is"). 

Joint ventures or partnerships are the only way to operate in some countries. Start your research with our [exporting country guides](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides "exporting country guides").

In some countries it can be difficult to part with an agent or distributor before the end of their contract and they may have a legal right to compensation. 

Take time to choose the right agent or distributor. Discuss their experience and ask for a list of other exporters they represent who you can contact for a reference. Get listings and recommendations for agents or distributors from:

- other companies operating in the same sector
- contacts at trade fairs and exhibitions
- UK and overseas trade associations
- our [international trade adviser network](https://www.contactus.trade.gov.uk/office-finder/ "Find a Department for International Trade office")

You should detail responsibilities, targets and how they&rsquo;ll be measured in a written agreement. Get legal help to create the contract.

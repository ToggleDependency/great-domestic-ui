Common types of intellectual property are: 

- patents
- trade marks
- copyright

### Patents

You can apply for a patent to protect your ideas if it&rsquo;s a product, process, or new idea. You can&rsquo;t get a patent for a business method. 

You could protect your idea for free by keeping it secret. If you do tell someone, get them to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

### Trade marks

You don&rsquo;t have to register a trade mark, but it&rsquo;s the best way to protect it. To successfully register a trade mark it must be distinctive and not descriptive - it can&rsquo;t describe your product. 

### Copyright

Work that you create may get automatic protection without you needing to apply for it. These types of work include: 

- literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work
- software, web content and databases

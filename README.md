Simple form to collect some data on people/companies that are interested in being included in the directory.

# Front End

## Dependencies

You will need to have [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) installed and available in your PATH
You will need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (and npm) installed

## Setup

Install the node deps:

```bash
npm install
```

Then build the sass:

```bash
npm run sass-dev
```

## Dev

To enable easy development, you can have sass watch the scss file for changes.

```bash
npm run sass-watch
```

This will cause sass to rebuld the css files when the scss file changes.
